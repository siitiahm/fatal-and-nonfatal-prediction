Officer A announced his office and attempted to defend himself from the attack. However, at some point, Officer A started to fear for his life. Officer A then removed his firearm from its holster on the right side of his body and discharged one round, striking Subject 1 to the left side of his groin area. Subject 1, Subject 3, Subject 2, and Officer A were each transported by ambulances to Loyola Hospital. Subject 1 died from the gunshot wound.",Chicago,Off-duty; Christopher Middleton

2/4/2010,1,N,N,U,M,25,drug production,NA,1,U,M,Fairfax County Police Department,"On Thursday, February 4, 2010, the Department of Public Safety Communications received a 911 call that a man with a history of mental illness was using illegal narcotics, possessed a semi-automatic weapon, and made references regarding a “shootout.” Based on the man’s history and information provided by the complainant, the Special Weapons and Tactics Team (SWAT) was called out to take lead on the case. Additional entities to include the Crisis Negotiations Team and K9 were called to the scene to assist. Multiple unsuccessful attempts were made to establish contact with the man inside the residence. An Emergency Custody Order was issued by a magistrate, which obligated the Police Department to take physical custody of the individual and transport him to a facility where he could receive mental health treatment. A dialogue was established between the man and a uniformed SWAT officer positioned outside a basement window. The SWAT officer identified himself as an officer and attempted to persuade the man to surrender by exiting the front door. As the SWAT officer continued to negotiate with the man, other uniformed SWAT officers and a K9 officer positioned themselves inside the home but outside of the man’s bedroom. The subject suddenly charged from his location and fired a weapon multiple times at officers. A SWAT officer, who was positioned inside the home, immediately discharged his service weapon striking the subject. A SWAT medical officer and the Operations Medical Director immediately provided aid until relieved by Fire and Rescue personnel. The man was transported to Inova Fairfax Hospital where he was treated for his injuries. The man’s weapon, a BB gun that is powered by a CO₂ cartridge, was recovered at the scene.",FairfaxCounty,BB gun; mental illness
11/4/2010,1,N,N,U,M,50,suspicious vehicle,NA,1,U,M,Fairfax County Police Department,"On Thursday, November 4, 2010, at approximately 4:34 p.m., uniformed officers were dispatched to a suspicious vehicle complaint in the 2900 block of Westcott Street in Falls Church. A check of the provided vehicle registration revealed that the vehicle had been stolen the previous day. The officer confirmed the stolen status over the radio with the dispatcher. The officer parked his marked police vehicle about twenty yards away from the stolen vehicle and waited on additional officers to arrive. The suspect exited the stolen vehicle resulting in the officer displaying his service weapon and commanding the suspect to get on the ground. The suspect fled the scene causing the officer to give chase on foot. The officer was able to grab him and a struggle ensued. A second uniformed officer arrived on scene, and expeditiously exited his unmarked police vehicle to assist the first officer with the suspect. The second officer deployed his electronic control weapon, but it had no effect. The officers continued to struggle with the suspect trying to place him in handcuffs. The suspect punched the first officer in the face, allowing him to free himself from the officers’ grasp. The first officer then deployed oleoresin capsicum spray on the suspect to try to prevent his escape, but that had little effect. The suspect was able to enter the second officer’s unmarked police vehicle, which had been left running, and drive it away. A short time later, he returned to the scene, exited the stolen police vehicle and entered the original stolen vehicle. The second officer drew his service weapon and gave the verbal commands, “Police, don’t move,” but the suspect failed to comply and drove away. The second officer called a vehicle pursuit and additional uniformed officers, in marked police vehicles joined the pursuit. An uninvolved uniformed officer was marked out on a traffic stop at the 2800 block of Graham Road. Realizing the pursuit was likely to pass his location, the officer deployed Stop Sticks in an effort to end the pursuit and took a position of cover.

As Mr. Buckman left in a vehicle from the Speedway, 11301 Westport Road, he fled on I-265 east bound. The officers attempted to locate the subject on I-265 after he fled, driving erratically. They located the subject's vehicle (which was stolen) on the exit ramp from I-265 to Brownsboro Rd. Ofc. Lietz pursued the subject on foot into a wooded area. Mr. Buckman refused officer's commands to stop. Mr. Buckman was attempting to scale a wooden fence, when he turned abruptly with something in his hands. Ofc. Lietz stated Mr. Buckman made a movement with his hands, which he perceived to be the manipulation of a possible weapon and thus a deadly threat. Ofc.

Lietz to interpret these actions as a threat to himself, and potentially Ofc. Godfrey, and it was reasonable to take actions necessary to defend himself.

10/11/2010,1,N,N,W,M,U,NA,3,1,W,M,Milwaukee Police Department,"Lieutenant Mark Wroblewski of the Metropolitan Division Late Shift is typing this report. On Sunday October 10, 2010 at 11:25pm squads for the Fugitive Apprehension Unit went to N93 W25866 Riverview Ln Lisbon, Wi to look for Jeremy Spence who was wanted on warrant #J45666 for fleeing MPD IR# 10-269-0176. Upon arrival the officers observed Mr. Spence in the residence along with his mother. Officers contacted their sergeant who advised them to call for the Waukesha County Sheriff Department to help out. While waiting for the deputies to arrive the officers observed the mother going back and forth from a room just off of the front door area. When the Sheriff Deputies arrived they indicated they knew who Mr. Spence was, and that he has an extensive record including resisting and fleeing. Officers made contact with the mother and asked for permission to search the house. which she eventually granted. As officers entered the house they went to the room and found it to be a laundry room that led to the garage. As the officers entered the garage led by P.O. [redacted] Mr. Spence started the vehicle. P.O. [redacted] drew his issued weapon and ordered Mr. Spence to shut the vehicle off. WCSD made forced entry to the garage via the side service door but were unable to enter due to the amount of property blocking access. [redacted] attempted to get around the rear of the auto to gain an advantage on the driver but every time he tried Mr. Spence would put the car in reverse and back up. After approximately three attempts of getting to the driver side Mr. Spence floored the accelerator and placed the car in drive. The auto sped forward crashing through the overhead garage door and [redacted] fearing for [redacted]'s life and the deputies that were on containment on the other side of the door, P.O. [redacted] discharged his issued service weapon three times at 12:23am on October 11, 2010. The auto was struck two times in the trunk lid and Mr. Spence was struck in the head by the gunfire. The auto continued forward approximately 20 feet before crashing into an unoccupied pick-up truck that was parked on the drive pushing it over the curb line, Mr. Spence was taken into custody and transported to Froedtert Hospital for a GSW to the head by Waukesha County Sheriff and a Waukesha County Med Unit. Waukesha County Sheriff is the lead investigating agency and it will be reviewed by the Waukesha County District Attorney's Office.I spoke with P.O. [redacted] who gave the followinq statement. On October 10, 2010 he was checkinp for a fleeing suspect from Milwaukee (Jeremy Spence) in the Town of Lisbon along with P.O. [redacted], P.O. [redacted] and P.O. [redacted] and the Waukesha County Sheriff Office. P.O. [redacted] states he entered the residence with P.O. [redacted] following him. They located Mr. Spence sitting in the driver seat of a red auto in the attached garage with the overhead garage door closed. Mr. Spence started the vehicle and P.O. [redacted] states he drew his issued handgun and began giving commands for Mr. Spence to shut off the vehicle, which was running and show his hands, which he refused. During the commands Mr. Spence maintained eye contact with him (P.O. [redacted], P.O. [redacted] attempted to make his way behind the auto to gain access to the driver side where Mr. Spence was located to take him into custody. Every time P.O. [redacted] moved behind the auto, Mr. Spence would place the auto in reverse and begin to back up attempting to hit the offir.er and, blocking the route. P.O. [redated] states Mr. Spence began revving the engine and placed it in drive racing towards the closed overhead door. P.O. [redacted] fearing for the officers and deputies on the outside of the garage discharged his service weapon through the rear window of the auto prior to the auto crashing through the overhead door. The auto continued under the collapsed door and crashed into a parked pickup truck that was on the driveway.

04/28/2010,1,F,N,B,M,U,NA,9,2,W;W,F;M,Milwaukee Police Department,"On Wednesday 4-28-10 at approx. 6:35PM, District Two Police Officers [redacted] and [redacted], while responding to a call for service, discharged their service weapons at a suspect, Eddie L. Jones, causing his death. This incident was thoroughly investigated by both the Criminal Investigation Bureau and the District Attorney's office, and what follows is a summary of the investigation and ifs findings. It is not exhaustive of a!I details, and for a complete understanding of all aspects of the investigation, please refer to Milwaukee Police incident reports filed under 1R1011B0178.Both officers were interviewed on the night of the incident by ClB detectives, as well as District Attorney John Chisolm and personnel from his staff. Both officers gave statements that were consistent with one another, witness accounts and the physical evidence, and their statements are summarized as follows:On Wednesday 4-28-10, POs [redaced] and [redacted] were assigned as partners on Squad [redacted] early shift uniformed squad, with [redacted] driving. Between the beginning of their shift at 3:00PM and approx. 6:31PM, they responded to and handled several routine calls for service. At 6:31PM, they were dispatched to an assignment of ""Battery- Cutting"" at 1539 S. 9th St., with the information that a man was chasing a woman and was armed with a knife.PO [redacted] statement indicated that upon their arrival at this assignment, he observed numerous people who were in the street and on the sidewalks, and that several of them waved down the squad. He asked the citizens where the subject with the knife was, and they pointed towards a house that was just northeast of where the squad was parked. PO [redacted] and his partner then got out of the squad and walked in that direction. As they did so, he observed a heavyset black male sitting on the front steps of a porch, and he also observed that the male was holding another person, a black female, across his lap as one would hold a child. He could see that the female was bleeding from her face, and was agitated. At the same time, he saw that the male was holding a large butcher knife ln his right hand, and so he drew his service weapon (Smith and Wesson M&P .40 caliber handgun) and ordered the suspect to drop the knife by yelling this command several times.The suspect did not comply with his commands, and responded verbally to the officer's commands with words to the effect of ""back up."" The suspect then raised the knife in hls right hand, and PO [redacted] believed at that time that he was going to stab the female with the knife. The female was still laying across his lap, and the suspect's upper chest and head were isolated. He estimated his distance from the suspect as 10-15 feet. PO [redacted] then took aim at the suspect, and fired his weapon at him. He could not recall how many shots he fired (later examination of his weapon revealed that he fired seven rounds.) He a!so stated that his partner was standing to his right, and believes that she also fired at the suspect.PO [redacted] observed the suspect slump backwards after being shot, and the female immediately got up from his lap. He went to the female and checked on her condition. He notified his dispatcher via KSA radio that they had fired shots, and requested medical attention for the suspect. A Milwaukee Fire Dept. unit had been staged up the block, and they immediately responded to the scene and began tending to the suspect. Because of the immediate response of MFD personnel, he did not attempt any life saving measures on the suspect.Numerous other District Two squads responded to the scene very rapidly. The other responding squads began to take control of the scene, and PO [redacted] was escorted to a squad by other responding officers, where he remained until the arrival of CIB personnel. At no time did he talk to PO [redacted] prior to being interviewed.PO [redacted] was likewise interviewed by ClB personnel and DA Chisolm and his staff. She made a statement that was very consistent with that of PO [redacted]. She related that they were dispatched to the battery cutting assignment. As they were responding to the scene, she (as the officer not driving) was reading the CAD updates out loud, so that they both knew what they were responding to. When they arrived in the 1500 block of S. 9th St., she observed numerous people running around in the street in a chaotic scene. The squad came to a stop and she immediately exited and drew her service weapon, due to the nature of the assignment.There were several people pointing and yelling ""over there"" indicating in a northeast direction. She observed a black male subject holding a black female subject on his lap. She could see that the male was holding a large knife in his right hand, and was making motions as though he was stabbing the female. PO [redacted] was approx. 20-30 feet from the suspect at this time, and she pointed her weapon at the suspect and continued walking towards him. As she was doing so, she yelled at the suspect several times to drop the knife, but he ignored her commands. She also recalled that her partner was standing to her left.At some point she observed that the female was bleeding, and she feared that the suspect was going to stab her with the knife. The female's position was low enough on his body that she had a clear target of his chest and head. She took aim and fired two or three rounds at the suspect (examination of her weapon revealed that she fired two rounds.) She saw the suspect fall backwards and drop the knife, and the female got up and ran away. She approached the suspect and kicked the knife away from him. She also got on the radio and called for medical assistance for the suspect, as she could see he had been shot. She put on latex gloves in preparation for pertorming medical attention on the suspect, however a MFD engine pulled up almost immediately and began attending to the suspect. Other MPD squads also quickly arrived on the scene, and she was escorted to Sgt. [redacted] squad, where she remained until the arrival of CIB personnel. She did not interact with PO [redacted] during this time.CIB detectives subsequently interviewed the female subject of this incident, [redacted]. Her interview revealed that she and the suspect Eddie Jones had been previously engaged in a relationship, however they had split up due to his violent nature. He had been arrested recently for a domestic violence incident against her, and that she had obtained a restraining order against him. Over the past couple of days, Jones called her numerous times, telling her to drop the restraining order, and threatening to kil! her and her new boyfriend if she did not. She did report these threats to the police.On this date at approx. 6:00PM, she returned to her house, and upon walking towards her house, she saw Jones approach her and someone yelled for her to run and that Jones had a knife. She ran away, but Jones caught up to her and the two struggled. He pushed her to the ground and held the knife to her throat, while making verbal threats to kill her. As this was going on, she saw the police arrive at the scene, and the officers subsequently shot Jones.lt should be noted that [redacted] was highly intoxicated and equally agitated at the time she was interviewed, and while she did not provide a great level of detail, what she did tell was consistent with the officers' statements, other witness statements and the physical evidence.Another citizen eyewitness to the incident [redacted] was interviewed as part of this investigation. [redacted] lives across the street from the scene, and he observed the incident from his front porch and yard area. Additionally, he recorded the incident on his camera phone, which he voluntarily turned over to detectives in order to extract the video. The video is of surprisingly good quality, and shows the events that occurred prior to police arrival, as well as the arrival the squad on the scene. It clearly shows the squad pull up to the scene, shows the two officers exit the squad, approach the suspect with their guns drawn, and order the suspect to drop the knife. It shows the officers fire several shots at the suspect, but as soon as the shots are heard, the camera operator moves the camera away from the scene, as though he were startled by the shots. He regains his composure and continues filming the aftermath of the shooting, including the arrival of MFD and additional squads on the scene.The actions of both officers was clearly captured on the video, and it is consistent in all ways with both of their accounts. This video is in the possession of MPD should it be needed for review or training purposes.Numerous other citizen witnesses were interviewed, and all provided substantially similar versions of events.Subsequent to their statements on the night of the incident, all standard protocols for an officer-involved shooting were complied with, including collecting the officers' weapons, issuing new weapons to them, placing them on administrative duty, and conveying them for drug testing.On 4-29-10, Dr. Rogalska of the Milwaukee County Medical Examiner's office conducted an autopsy on the suspect Jones. The cause of death was deermined to be from numerous gunshot wounds, and the manner of death ruled a homicide. A total of 10 gunshot wounds (entrance and exit) wounds were noted to the suspect's head, neck and chest. A total of seven bullets, as well as several small bullet fragments were recovered from Jones' body during the autopsy.On Tuesday 5-4-10, this incident was formally reviewed by DA Chisolm for the purposes of determining the legality of the officers' actions. DA Chisolm indicated that it was his legal opinion that both officers acted properly and within the guidelines of the !aw when they used deadly force to stop the life-threatening actions of the suspect Eddie Jones.",Milwaukee,"7 shots fired from one PO, 2 shots from other PO; number of hits unknown — 10 gunshot wounds (entrances and exits), 7 bullets in victim's body; knife"

They were assigned to a foot beat, and were walking near N. 39th and W. Wright. While patrolling their beat, they decided to walk into the alley between N 38 and N 39 in the 2500 block to check out agarage that had been burglarized in the past. When they got to this alley, the officers observed a maroon Volvo parked in the alley, with the engine running and it's lights off. The officers found this to be suspicious, and decided to approach the car and investigate.The officers walked up to the car, with PO [redacted] standing at the driver's side and PO [redacted] standing near the front of the car. PO [redacted] shined his flashlight into the car, lighting up the inside, and they both saw several occupants inside. A voice from inside the car said, ""oh shit"" and immediately, the rear seat occupant reached out of the right side rear window, holding a sawed-off shotgun. The suspect pointed the shotgun in the direction of PO [redacted] and fired one shot. At the same time, the car began moving forward.PO [redacted], having just been shot at, feared for his safety and that of his partner, and drew his duty pistol and began firing at the rear passenger area of the car where the suspect was seated. PO [redacted], having witnessed his partner being shot at, also drew his weapon and fired at the suspect in the car as it drove past. PO [redacted] fired 12 rounds, and PO [redacted] fired eight rounds. They immediately called out this incident over their portable radios.The suspect car traveled north in the alley, and at one point PO [redacted] reported hearing another shot from the suspect auto. It then turned east onto Wright and drove approximately 4 blocks to N. 35th St. There the driver tried to make a right turn, but lost control and crashed. The three occupants of the car (the listed suspects) exited theauto and fled on foot. District Three squads in the immediate area observed the suspect Logan flee on foot, and he was taken into custody after a brief foot chase. Other District Three squads, having responded to the scene, set up a perimeter and conducted a yard search, where the suspects May and Garcia were taken into custody.

Wright St., which is along the suspect auto's route of flight. There was a single fired shell in the chamber. A cursory examination of the interior of the auto revealed a plastic bag containing a quantity of .410 shotgun shells.At the original scene, detective discovered and recovered twelve .40cal casings near the area where PO [redacted] was standing, and seven .40cal casings near where PO [redacted] was standing when he fired.Both officers' weapons and magazines were inspected by detectives as part of the interview process.

They spent the next few hours together, eating some food at Garcia's house, and driving around and smoking some marijuana. They stopped at a gas station to buy some ""blunts"" for smoking marijuana. At some point, Garcia allowed May to drive the car, as Garcia was too high and was on prescription medications. At one point they went to May's house, where May retrieved the shotgun, and they got back into the car. They then drove to Logan's house and picked him up, and the three of them continued to drive around. Logan wanted to fire the shotgun, so they drove into an alley. May loaded the gun and handed it to Logan, who held it out the window. Garcia saw a flashlight shining at them, which he described as a ""cop's flashlight."" Logan then fired one shot from the shotgun, and May drove off, and he heard numerous shots being fired at them. During this he heard Logan something to the effect of, ""it's the police, !et me out."" They then drove a short distance until May crashed the car, when they all got out and ran, and he was eventually taken into custody.Colby Logan was interviewed by CIB detectives, and eventually gave the following account: He was picked up in the evening by May and Garcia who are friends of his and they drove around. May was driving, Garcia was in the front passenger seat and Logan at in the back seat. They drove around and smoked some marijuana while they did so.

His statement was consistent with that of other officers, witness accounts and the physical evidence, and his statement is summarized as follows:On Tuesday 9-14~10, PO [redaced] was working on Squad [redacted with his partner, PO [redacted], working late power hours, 7PM-3AM. Both officers were in uniform and driving a marked MPD squad. He recalled that they were on patrol, when they heard and responded to a call from another squad requesting backup at a Battery DV assignment at 25th/Wells. The suspect was supposed to be inside of a house there, armed with a shotgun. Sq. 3430 and several other squads responded to the backup, where they learned that the suspect was located inside of 755 N. 25th St. The officers formulated a strategy to arrest the suspect, and PO [redacted] and his partner were assigned to rear containment on the house. The officers approached the house, and POs [redacted], along with PO [redacted] proceeded to the rear of the house for containment, while other officers approached the front of the house.The three officers went to the rear, and PO [redacted] drew his service weapon due to the possibility of the suspect being armed. At the rear of the house, he could see an illuminated 2nd story window with a box fan in the window. At the same time he could hear the other officers at the front of the house attempting to make contact with the suspect. After about 10 seconds, he saw the box fan being removed from the window, and a black male suspect, slender and in his 20s, wearing a white T-shirt appeared in the window. The suspect was holding a shotgun with both hands, standing in a bladed stance and pointing the shotgun in the direction of PO [redacted]. PO [redacted] ordered the suspect to ""drop the gun"" and believes that his partner also made this command. The suspect did not drop the gun, and PO [redacted], fearing that the suspect was going to shoot at them, fired one shot from his handgun at the suspect. He was about 8-10 feet away from the outside wall of the house at this time. After the shot the suspect retreated back into the house, and PO [redacted] heard another officer announcing the shots fired. PO [redacted] maintained his position on rear containment, and a short time later he heard the other officers announce that the suspect was in custody, and also request medical attention for his gunshot wound, and that was when he first knew for certain that he had struck the suspect. Shortly after that Sgt. [redacted] came to the rear of the house, relieved [redacted] from his post and took him to Sgt [redacted] car, where he remained until CIB detectives arrived. PO [redacted] was armed with his standard issue M&P 40 handgun. His weapon was examined and found to have an unfired round in the chamber and 13 rounds in the magazine, consistent with his account of firing one shot. Additionally one spent .40 cal shell casing was found at the rear of the house.Subsequent to his statement on the day of the incident, all standard protocols for an officer-involved shooting were complied with, including collecting PO [redacted] weapon, issuing a new weapon to him, placing him on administrative duty, and conveying him for drug testing.PO [redacted] was also interviewed on the night of this incident by CIB detectives and gave the following account: He was working with PO [redacted] on Sq. [redacted] when they responded to the request for backup at the Battery DV complaint, with a suspect armed wlth a shotgun. When they arrived at the house, himself, PO [redacted] and PO [redacted] went to the rear of the house for containment. He stood near the southwest corner of the residence, while PO [redacted] went to the northwest corner, while Jelinek stood between them. A short time later he heard movement inside the house, and he looked up and saw a black male sticking his head and shoulder sticking out of the window, holding a shotgun that he was pointing down at PO [redacted] and he yelled for the suspect to drop the gun. PO [redacted] heard a single gunshot, and saw the suspect retreat back inside the house, but he could not tell at that instant which of the other officers fired the shot. PO [redacted] had his own gun drawn but he did not fire. Shortly after that he heard the other officers say that the suspect was in custody.Numerous other officers who were present at this incident were also interviewed and gave accounts substantially similar to those of POs [redacted] and [redacted]. Additionally, several citizens witnesses were interviewed and provided partial accounts that were consistent with the officers' statements, however no citizen was found to be a direct eyewitness to the shooting incident. The suspect Kenneth Whitaker was interviewed by detectives about his involvement. He had been treated for a minor gunshot wound to his left shoulder and released from the hospital. He gave several untruthful versions of events, but eventually admitted that he was present inside the house, that his brother had removed the box fan from the window that that he (Whitaker) had held the shotgun out the window for the purpose of placing it onto a ledge to hide it. He did admit that while he was holding the gun out the window it was pointed down towards the ground, however he did not admit to pointing it intentionally at the officers.The scene investigation revealed a sawed-off Mossberg 500 shotgun inside the upper bedroom where the officers had observed the suspect pointing the gun out of the window.

12/20/2010,1,F,N,B,M,U,NA,NA,2,B;W,M;M,Milwaukee Police Department,"This report is submitted by Lt. Jeff Point of the GIB Metro- Homicide Unit, early shift.On Monday 12-20-10 at approx. 12:21AM, District Seven Police Officers [redacted] and [redacted] while responding to a ca!I for service, discharged their service weapons at a suspect, Dionne A Brown, causing his death. This incident was thoroughly investigated by both the Criminal Investigation Bureau and the District Attorney's office, and what follows is a summary of the investigation and it's findings. It is not exhaustive of all details, and for a complete understanding of all aspects of the investigation, please refer to Milwaukee Police incident reports filed under IR103540005.Both officers were interviewed ClB detectives, as well as District Attorney John Chisolm and personnel from his staff. Both officers gave statements that were consistent with one another, witness accounts and the physical evidence, and their statements are summarized as follows:PO [redacted] stated that on Sunday 12-19-10, he was working on Squad [redacted] with his partner, PO [redacted]. Their hours that day were 7:00PM to 3:00AM. It should be noted that they had worked an overtime assignment from 3:00PM to 7:00PM, prior to their shift. They were both in full uniform at the time of this assignment.At approx. 11:46PM, they noted that among the backlog of assignments was an entry complaint at [redacted] and they volunteered for this assignment. Upon their arrival, they met with the complainant, [redacted] who related to them that her ex-boyfriend, Dionne Brown, had stolen items from her house, and that she could hear movement up in her attic and believed that Brown was hiding in the attic. She further informed the officers that Brown had a warrant for his arrest, and that is why he was hiding. She then directed the officers to the 2nd floor of the apartment, where the attic could be accessed via a scuttle hole in the ceiling. The officers opened the scuttle hole, and called into the attic and called out to Brown by name and told him to come down, but they got no response. PO [redacted] then used a chair and pulled himself up into the attic. The attic was not lighted, so used his flashlight to look around. He also drew his service weapon. The floor of the attic was covered with approx. 18 inches of blown insulation. PO [redacted] observed what he believed to be a person laying on the ground ln the west portion of the attic, trying to conceal himself under the insulation. He could see the insulation rising and falling with the suspect' s breathing. At about this same time, he saw an 11 inch kitchen knife laying on the floor near the attic opening, and he picked this knife up and moved it further away, to keep it out of reach of the suspect.After moving the knife, PO [redacted] holstered his weapon and drew his expandable baton. He used the baton to probe where the suspect (later ID' d as Brown) was hiding by tapping him. Brown then began to sit up, exposing his face, and PO [redacted] took several steps back to increase the distance between them. Brown stated to PO [redacted], ""Man, you broke my nose."" PO [redacted] began to order Brown to come out and show himself, but Brown did not.At some point, PO [redacted] became aware that another officer (PO [redacted]) had entered the attic, and was standing to his left and behind him. Brown then sat up and rotated his body so he was facing PO [redacted]. Brown reached into his front waistband with his right hand, and made a deliberate motion as though he was removingsomething from his waistband. Due to the insulation, PO [redacted] could not see what he was reaching for, but based on the movement, he believed Brown was reaching for a weapon. Both officers then yelled for Brown to show his hands several times.After about 25 seconds of this, Brown suddenly lunged at PO [redacted]. He both lunged with his body, and extended his right arm towards PO [redacted], causing [redacted] to fear that he had a weapon. Fearing for his safety and his partner's, he immediatelv began firing his weapon at Brown. He fired his handgun until the slide locked back. He was also aware that PO [redacted] was also firing his own weapon. PO [redacted] took a step to his left to avoid the lunge of Brown. Brown fell past him and fell down in a facedown position. Both officers approached Brown and handcuffed him behind his back. They then called down to the other officers and requested medical attention, and that the suspect was PNB.At about this time, PO [redacted] felt coldness around his left buttock.He checked his body and found a hole in his pants in that area, and he realized that he had been shot. The bullet wound was a graze wound, and was minor enough that PO [redacted] was able to lower himself out of the attic. He was subsequently taken to St. Joseph's Hospital, where he was treated and released for his minor injury.Prior to being conveyed to the hospital, PO [redacted] duty belt and handgun was taken from him and secured. It was subsequently examined by detectives, and was found to be unloaded with an empty magazine inserted. This is consistent with his account of firing to lock back, but having not reloaded. His handgun and magazines were invventoried and a replacement handgun issued to him.PO [redacted] was also interviewed about his actions in this incident, and he gave the following account. PO [redacted] was working on Sunday 12-19-10, and was working on Squad [redacted] with his partner, PO [redacted]. Their hours of work were 7:00PM to 3:00AM. Both officers were in full MPD uniform at the time of their shift. At approx. 12:15AM, they were on patrol, and they heard PO [redacted] of Squad [redacted] requesting another squad and a sergeant at their assignment, and they volunteered. En route, they read the CAD call for this assignment and learned that they were going to an entry complaint and that the caller was irate.When they got to the apartment, they went inside. He observed PO [redacted] standing near the top of the stairs, and he was told that PO [redacted] was up in the attic with a possible suspect, and volunteered to go up into the attic to help PO [redacted]. He climbed up through the scuttle hole into the attic. Once he got into the attic, he could see that [redacted] was in the attic, and was pointing his flashlight at a suspect who was under the insulation. [redacted] could only see the suspect' s face, and [redacted] could see that he was a black male. It was very dark, and he also used his flashlight to light up the suspect. He and [redacted] both yelled for the suspect to show his hands. They were about six to eight feet away from him at this time, and they moved closer to him, to take him into custody. The attic space they were in was very small and cramped, limiting their ability to move around.PO [redacted] saw the suspect (Dionne Brown) sit up, and begin looking around him as though looking for something. He then reached with his right hand towards his waistband, as though he was reaching for a weapon. PO [redacted] feared that Brown was reaching for a weapon, and he and PO [redacted] were in close proximity to Brown. Brown then lunged towards [redacted] and thrust his right arm forward, in a motion as though to stab him. He then drew his service we·aoon and began firing at Brown in an effort to stop his aggressive actions. [redacted] was also firing at the suspect, and while doing so, he stepped in front of [redacted] so [redacted] stopped firing. [redacted] then stepped out of this line of fire, and [redacted] could see that Brown was still swinging his arm at PO [redacted] as though trying to cut him with a knife, so he continued to fire at Brown. He fired until his weapon locked back on the empty magainze, and then reloaded it.At this time, he could see that Brown had stopped moving and was laying face down, and did not apoear to be a threat any longer. He then re-holstered his weapon, and both officers handcuffed the suspect. They then yelled down to the other officers that they were OK. PO [redacted] then informed [redacted] that he thought he had been shot in the buttocks, and [redacted] observed a tear and blood on his pants near his left buttocks. At this time he realized that he had probably accidentally shot PO during this incident, and told this to [redacted].Very shortly after this happened, PO [redacted] heard the voice of Sgt. [redacted] coming from downstairs. Sgt. [redacted] egan directing the actions of the officers and asking them questions about the suspect's condition and what happened. Sgt. [redacted] instructed [redacted] to come down from the attic, and he did so. He was taken by Sgt. [redacted] to Sgt. [redacted]'s squad, where he remained until ClB arrived.PO [redacted] issued Smith & Wesson handgun was examined by detectives at the scene. His handgun was loaded with a magazine and 13 rounds, plus one round in the chamber. One of the magazines in his pouch was empty (which he recovered after the shooting.) This is consistent with his account that he fired his gun until the slide locked back. His handgun and magazines were inventoried, and a replacement handgun issued to him.Subsequent to their statements on the night of the incident, all standard protocols for an officer-involved shooting were complied with, including inventorying the officers' weapons, issuing new weapons to them, placing them on administrative duty, and conveying them for drug testing.PO [redacted] partner on this day was PO [redacted]. PO [redacted] was also interviewed, and gave the following account. He and PO [redacted] were working togetner on this night, and they responded to the call for another squad at [redacted]. When they got to the apartment and went in, there were two citizens in the lower unit, and PO [redacted] was standing at the top of the stairs. PO [redacted] told them that his partner, PO [redacted] was up in the attic with the suspect, and he asked one of them to go up and help him, and PO  [redacted] volunteered. PO [redacted] could hear [redacted] saying, ""keep showing me your hands, I know you have a knife"" but could not see him in the attic. He then heard both officers ordering the suspect to show his hands, followed by 5-8 gunshots. He was not in a position to observe the actions of the officers or the suspect. He called up to the officers, who told him that they were OK. He then got on the radio and requested additional squads, a sergeant and a med unit.PO [redacted] handgun was examined, and did not appear to have been fired.PO [redacted] partner, PO [redacted] was interviewed by detectives and gave the following account. He and [redacted] had been dispatched to the entry complaint at 4321 W. Olive at about 11:46PM. When they got to the scene, the female caller [redacted] let them in the apartment and explained that her ex-boyfriend had broken in and was in the attic. The officers went upstairs and tried to make verbal contact with Brown. When they could not get him to respond, PO [redacted] volunteered to go up into the attic, and PO [redacted] helped him lift himself into the attic.PO [redacted] could hear his partner say to Brown that he could see him under the insulation. Wilson also said that he had found a knife in the attic. PO [redacted] radioed for an additional squad, and POs [redacted] and [redacted] arrived a few minutes later. PO [redacted] also went up into the attic with PO [redacted]. About 10-20 seconds later, he heard PO [redacted] yell to the suspect to show his hands. PO [redacted] repeated this command several times, and after that, PO [redacted] heard the sound of shots coming from the attic. He heard 5-10 shots, but could not see what was happening in the attic. Both officers in the attic yelled down that they were OK. PO [redacted] radioed for medical attention and additional squads, and PO [redacted] went downstairs to check on the occupants of the house. When he got downstairs he found that they had all left, but he located them in the rear of the house and brought them back inside.PO [redacted] handgun was examined, and did not appear to have been fired.A citizen witness, [redacted] (B/F, DOB) was interviewed by detectives, and gave the following account. She resides at the apartment where this incident occurred, and the suspect Brown is her ex-boyfriend. She related that on this date at about 8:00PM, she received a call from Brown, and he indicated that he had broken into her apartment and was going to steal her TV and her childrens' Christmas presents if she did not come back home. She, along with several members of her family, then went back to her apartment. When they entered, they found items missing, leading her to believe that Brown had in fact been inside her apartment. She then called the police to report the burglary. When the officers arrived, as she was letting them in the door, she saw the wooden board which covers the scuttle ho!e being moved, and at that time realized that Brown was probably hiding in the attic, and she informed the police of this. The officers went upstairs, and she could hear them calling out to Brown by his name and trying to talk him out of the attic. She left the apartment and went and sat in her vehicle and made a phone call. As she was doing this, she heard 6-8 gunshots coming from inside her apartment. Shortly after that more police officers arrived on the scene, and she was escorted back into her apartment.Another citizen witness was interviewed- [redacted] B/M [redacted] who resides at [redacted] is the brother of [redacted]. Mr. [redacted] was interviewed by detectives, and gave an account very similar to his sister's. He stated that once they all arrived back at her house and found that it had been entered, she called the police, and they waited for the police to arrive. At around the time that the police arrived, he went upstairs, and he could hear someone walking around in theattic, and he informed the police of this.[redacted] heard one of the officers who went upstairs say that he had found some knives in the attic. Another squad arrived, and two more officers came inside the house. [redacted] was seated on the couch in the living room on the first floor. He heard the officers calling out to Brown by name, trying to talk him out of the attic. After a while of this, he heard the officers ordering Brown to show his hands, the he heard 5-6 shots coming from upstairs. At this time, Jones got up from the couch and ran to the back of the apartment, towards the rear exit, and at this time he heard additional shots coming from upstairs. He then went outside to where his sister [redacted] was seated in her car. They remained there until more officers arrived, at which time they were escorted back into the apartment, and eventually separated and placed into squad cars until they could be interviewed by detectives.It should be noted that there two additional citizen witnesses who were present inside the apartment and were a!so witnesses to this incident. Their accounts are substantially similar to those of [redacted] and [redacted]. Both were interviewed by detectives and their statements are contained on supplemental reports.This incident took place in the attic above the apartment located at [redacted] in the [redacted]. The attic is unfinished, and the floor of it was covered with approx. 18 inches of blown insulation. lt should be noted that Brown was pronounced dead while still in the attic, and his body was removed from the attic area, through the scuttle hole, by MFD personnel. This attic was searched extensively by numerous detectives over the course of two days. A total of 26 .40 cal Speer shell casings were recovered, as well as 13 fired bullets. The scene was extensively photographed, measured and documented by the investigating detectives.On Monday 12-20-10, an autopsy was conducted by the Milwaukee County Medical Examiners office. Brown sustained a total of 43 gunshot wounds throughout his body, which were caused by 27 different bullets (it should be noted that in many cases, a single bullet can cause multiple wounds.) A total of 13 additional bullets were recovered during the autopsy.On Tuesday 1-11-11 at 10:00AM, Del. Marco Salaam and myself met with Deputy DA Kent Lovern and DA Investigator Tom Boehlke for a formal review of this case. Dep. DA Lovern was provided with a complete copy of the file in this case. After reviewing the reports and evidence, Dep. DA Lovern informed us that it was his legal opinion that the officers in this case acted within the guidelines of the law when they used deadly force against Dionne Brown, and that no criminal charges would be issued.
