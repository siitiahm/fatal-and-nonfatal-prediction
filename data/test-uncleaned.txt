4/1/2010,1,F,Y,L,M,32,NA,1,1,U,U,New York Police Department,"On April 1, at 1413 hours, in the confines of the 72nd Precinct, plainclothes officers were can‐ vassing for a robbery suspect with a sketch and photo in hand. They observed a male Hispanic subject who they believed resembled the suspect and attempted to address him from their unmarked vehicle. As the vehicle operator called to the subject, the two other officers in the vehicle exited and positioned themselves at the front and rear of the automobile. The subject suddenly and aggressively approached the vehicle, saying “You want my fuckin’ ID? I’ll show you my fuckin’ ID!” At the same time, he reached into a bag he was carrying and withdrew a silver revolver, which he pointed into the car and at the officer in the driver’s seat. A brief struggle ensued, but was ended when the female officer positioned at the front end of the ve‐ hicle fired a single round, striking the subject and causing his demise. The subject’s weapon, a loaded .357 caliber Rossi revolver, was recovered, as was a stolen .44 caliber Ruger revolver also on his person, several bags of marijuana, and in excess of $2,000 in US currency. The subject had 39 prior arrests, for offenses including robbery, burglary, and criminal possession of firearms. The subject had cannabinoids in his system at the time of the incident.",New York,FIREARMS
10/3/2010,1,F,N,L,M,24,NA,5;4,2,U,U,New York Police Department,"On October 3, at approximately 0545 hours, in the confines of the 34th Precinct, ten uni‐ formed officers responded to a radio run for a violent emotionally disturbed person. A male Hispanic subject had called 911 and stated “I’m ready to kill some cops right now... Get ‘em, I’ll be right here.” As they converged on the location, they observed the subject with a black knife in his hand. Maintaining cover behind parked cars, the officers surrounded the subject and is‐ sued orders to drop the knife, which the subject ignored. The subject made threatening state‐ ments, and acted belligerently. A sergeant on scene deployed a conducted energy device, but it was ineffective and the subject was able to pull the prongs from his body. At this time the subject began to move, and the sergeant on scene instructed the officers to move with him while maintaining a proper zone of safety. Two officers, however, found themselves backed against parked vehicles as the subject abruptly changed direction and advanced upon them while swinging the knife. With no means of escape available, the two officers discharged their firearms, five rounds and four rounds, respectively. The subject was struck multiple times and succumbed to his injuries. The subject had an arrest history for crimes including reckless en‐ dangerment and drugs sales, and was on federal probation for heroin trafficking at the time of the incident.",New York,KNIFE
3/8/2010,1,F,N,W,M,23,NA,3,1,U,U,New York Police Department,"On March 8, at 1511 hours, in the confines of the 61st Precinct, a uniformed police officer responded to a 911 call of a man with a gun present in a schoolyard. Witnesses had seen the man acting erratically and pointing the firearm at passerby. Once at the location, the officer, who was on solo patrol, encountered a white male subject carrying a silver firearm. With his firearm drawn, the officer shouted “Police! Don’t move!” but the subject turned his back to the officer. As the officer radioed that he had the subject stopped, the subject abruptly spun and pointed his firearm directly at the officer while cursing him. The officer fired three rounds, striking the subject three times, and causing his demise. Subsequently, the subject’s firearm was determined to be an imitation pistol that had been painted silver and black. The subject had an arrest history for criminal mischief and false personation. At the time of the incident, the subject’s blood alcohol content was three and a half times the legal limit for driving and he had phencyclidine (PCP) in his system, as well as anti‐anxiety drugs and other substances consistent with reports that he had stolen and then consumed significant quantities of cough suppressant.",New York,IMITATION
8/8/2010,1,F,Y,L,U,U,NA,16;16;2;12,4,U,U,New York Police Department,"On August 8, at approximately 0300 hours, in the confines of the 32nd Precinct, four officers became involved in an exchange of gunfire with two male Hispanic subjects, resulting in the demise of one subject and injuries to the other. Two officers were injured during this incident, and three bystanders were struck and injured, as well. The event was precipitated by a fight between the two subjects, during which the first subject produced a firearm and possibly fired on the second subject. Police heard gunfire and responded: one uniformed officer approached from the south as an unmarked vehicle with one plainclothes sergeant and two plainclothes officers approached from the north.

2/26/15,1,F,N,L,M,U,Violent altercation,4-5,2,,M;M,San Francisco Police Department,"On the evening of February 26, 2015, Amilcar Perez-Lopez (Perez-Lopez) and a second man (Abraham P.) were involved in an altercation which resulted in a knife chase down the 2800 block of Folsom Street. Different accounts have surfaced regarding what led to the knife chase. Abraham P. told investigators that Perez-Lopez wanted to buy his bike and chased him with a knife when he refused to sell it to him. Press accounts reported that Perez-Lopez chased Abraham P. with a knife because Abraham P. had taken his cell phone. (The cell phone was later located by police in Perez-Lopez’s pocket.) A roommate of Perez-Lopez told investigators that Abraham P. had been arguing with Perez-Lopez about whether Perez-Lopez lived at 2843 Folsom Street and had blocked Perez-Lopez from entering the house, when Perez-Lopez walked away but then returned, ran into the house to get a knife, and then ran out of the house and chased Abraham P. down Folsom Street, yelling “Aren’t you macho!” This last account is supported by a MUNI bus video which appears to show Perez-Lopez and Abraham P. standing and facing each other inside the gated area of 2843 Folsom Street, with Abraham P. possibly blocking the entrance to the home. As described in detail in the witness statements below, the knife chase was observed by a neighbor who was out for a jog and by a woman who was waiting for a bus. At 9:44 p.m., the neighbor called 911, described what he had seen, and said he was located at 24th and Folsom Streets, near the bus stop. He described both men as Latin males, five feet, five inches tall, in their thirties, and he gave the address of the house on Folsom Street he believed they may have come out of. The witness described the knife the man was carrying as approximately 12-inches long and shiny, and said both men were running very fast. Based on the 911 call, at 9:45 p.m. SFPD dispatch broadcasted a report of a person with a knife at 24th and Folsom Streets. A marked police unit and a backup unit immediately began a Code 3 response (lights and sirens activated) to the scene. Dispatch further advised officers that the reporting person said that a man was chasing another man with a knife, now running towards 25th Street; that both men were around 5 foot 5 inches tall wearing beanies; and that the men were yelling in Spanish and may have come out of a house on Folsom Street. Additional police units began responding to the scene in Code 3. STATEMENTS OF OFFICERS INVOLVED IN THE SHOOTING Officers Eric Reboli (Star # 1651) and Craig Tiffe (Star # 1312) were in plainclothes and travelling in an unmarked police car near 24th and Harrison Streets when they heard the first broadcast. Officer Reboli was driving and Officer Tiffe was in the front passenger seat. At 9:46 p.m. Officer Tiffe used the computer in their car to electronically place them on the call as a backup responder. Because they were so close to the location, they did not make a Code 3 response. According to Officer Reboli, as they reached the intersection of 25th and Folsom Streets, he saw movement mid-block on the east side of Folsom Street which looked like people running around in the street. He turned the car and proceeded northbound on Folsom Street. Approximately mid-block he saw a male (Abraham P.) standing in the lane of traffic while 2 leaning against a parked car (a blue Nissan), and a second male (Perez-Lopez) standing on the sidewalk, on the opposite side of the parked car. He alerted Officer Tiffe to the presence of the two men, and then parked one to two car lengths behind the blue Nissan. He got out of the driver’s side of the unmarked police car and went to make contact with Abraham P., who was still standing in the lane of traffic. Officer Reboli was wearing his police star clipped to his belt directly in front of his holstered firearm. He announced himself as a police officer and then immediately grabbed Abraham P. by both arms and pinned his arms together in case he was the man with the knife, referenced in the broadcast. Officer Reboli observed that Abraham P. was breathing hard, seemed “almost exhausted,” and was saying something he did not understand. Officer Reboli told Abraham P. they were going to get out of the street and figure out what was going on, and then walked him towards the sidewalk, between the blue Nissan and a silver Toyota parked in front of it. As he was walking Abraham P. in between the two parked cars towards the sidewalk to get him out of the lane of traffic, he glanced over the car at the sidewalk and saw Officer Tiffe speaking to Perez-Lopez, who had his back to Officer Reboli. A few seconds later, Officer Reboli glanced over again and saw Officer Tiffe trying to take Perez-Lopez down to the ground and Perez-Lopez “violently resisting.” Officer Reboli immediately let go of Abraham P. and ran to assist his partner. Once he was five or six feet away from Officer Tiffe and Perez-Lopez, he saw Officer Tiffe lunge backwards and put his hands up with his palms facing outward, “saw a flash of a very large silver knife,” and thought Officer Tiffe may have been stabbed. After he saw Officer Tiffe lunge backwards and saw the flash of the knife, Officer Reboli saw Perez-Lopez turn, face him and start to run in his direction. Officer Reboli stopped, took one or two large steps backwards and reached for his pepper spray and firearm at the same time. He drew his firearm but was unable to get the pepper spray out of his pocket.1 He then shouted either “Police, drop the knife” or “Drop the knife,” at which point Perez-Lopez momentarily stopped, looked at him and then back at Officer Tiffe, and then continued to advance towards Officer Reboli while holding the knife and making slashing motions. Officer Reboli could not recall in which hand Perez-Lopez held the knife, but thought the knife was held with the blade facing out and upward. Officer Reboli said Perez-Lopez was still on the sidewalk, but near the curb, approximately five to six feet away from him. As Perez-Lopez came towards him, he feared he was about to be stabbed. He also feared for the life of his partner, who he thought may have been stabbed, and for the life of Abraham P., who he believed was still in very close proximity. Officer Reboli said he discharged his firearm at Perez-Lopez to stop the threat to his life and to the lives of his partner and Abraham P. Officer Reboli explained that, once he started to discharge his firearm, Perez-Lopez began turning toward the street, then took a step or two before collapsing, face-down between the two parked cars. Officer Reboli saw the knife fall from Perez-Lopez’ grip and watched as it came to rest in the street, above Perez-Lopez’ left shoulder but within his reach. 1 Photos taken of Officer Reboli right after the shooting show what appears to be the top of a pepper spray canister in his right rear pocket, the same side on which his firearm was carried. 3 According to Officer Tiffe, as he and Officer Reboli drove down Folsom Street in response to the 911 dispatch, he initially only saw Abraham P. standing near the driver’s side door the blue Nissan, close to the side-view mirror. As he exited the passenger side of the police car, he saw Perez-Lopez near the side-view mirror on the passenger side of the blue Nissan. At that point, both males were facing each other from opposite sides of the car. Officer Tiffe had his police star displayed on his chest, hanging from a silver chain on the outside of his jacket. He approached Perez-Lopez on the sidewalk from the rear passenger side of the blue Nissan, as Perez-Lopez stood leaning on the car with his body facing towards the street, leaving only his left side visible to Officer Tiffe. As Officer Tiffe reached the rear bumper of the blue Nissan, Perez-Lopez looked over his left shoulder and made eye contact with him. Officer Tiffe said he thought Perez-Lopez appeared to be in some type of altered state and described the look on his face as “bloodlust crazed.” He announced himself as a police officer as he walked towards Perez-Lopez and asked him to step away from the car. He continued walking towards Perez-Lopez, who did not move away from the car as commanded and did not acknowledge him. Officer Tiffe then pointed to the star on his chest, in case Perez-Lopez did not speak English, but he could not tell if Perez-Lopez looked at it or understood he was a police officer since he said nothing and simply appeared to “look through” him. Officer Tiffe believed that Perez-Lopez was either “on something” or too engaged in what he was doing to respond to verbal commands, so he decided to make physical contact with him. As Officer Tiffe got close to Perez-Lopez, he saw Perez-Lopez’s left hand go up, so he grabbed Perez-Lopez’s left arm and his right, back shoulder area, and pulled him away from the car. He then saw Perez-Lopez holding something in his right hand, which was down by his side. Officer Tiffe ordered Perez-Lopez to “Get on the ground!” and spun him around to try to forcibly take him down to the ground. As Officer Tiffe did this, Perez-Lopez suddenly lunged up at him with his right hand. Officer Tiffe disengaged from Perez-Lopez by pushing him about three feet away, and then he saw Perez-Lopez swipe at his chest with the object in his right hand. Once the swipe was completed, Officer Tiffe could see that the object in Perez-Lopez’ right hand was “a very large knife,” which Perez-Lopez was now waving around in the air with the blade pointing up. Officer Tiffe said he knew by this point that Officer Reboli had come to his aid and was on the sidewalk to his right, behind Perez-Lopez. As soon as he saw the knife in Perez-Lopez’s hand, Officer Tiffe drew his firearm and yelled either “Put down the knife” or “Put down the knife or I’ll shoot.” Officer Tiffe said he believed at that moment that Perez-Lopez was going to kill him if given the opportunity, and kill anybody in his way. As Officer Tiffe was shouting commands for Perez-Lopez to drop the knife and focusing on the knife “flailing in the air,” he heard Officer Reboli also yelling something, saw Perez-Lopez take a step in Officer Reboli’s direction with the knife raised, and heard shots. Officer Tiffe recalled that, as the shots were being fired, Perez-Lopez was “kind of moving in different directions,” was at some point “facing, at some point he was turning away,” and appeared to fixate on 4 something in the street, south of where he was standing. He then saw Perez-Lopez take a step between the two parked cars, and raise the knife, either in an outstretched or overhead manner. He didn’t know exactly where Abraham P. was at that point but believed he was very close and thought that Perez-Lopez was going after him, so he fired his weapon one time and saw Perez-Lopez fall to the ground. Officer Tiffe recalled that he next saw Abraham P. “cowering down” on the driver’s side of the blue Nissan, near the driver’s side rear tire, being talked to by Officer Cabillo, who had arrived at the scene moments after the shooting.",San Francisco,knife

Grand Ave. One of the employees was sweeping the lobby and held the door open for West as he entered. The employee then went behind the counter to take his order. West ordered and paid with cash. As the employee rang up the sale and the cash drawer opened, West pulled a gun from his clothes and pointed it at the employee. West reached over the counter and started grabbing money from the register drawer. The employee ran to the back of the kitchen to tell the on-duty manager what was happening. A customer that was in the drive-thru saw the robbery took place and called 911 then drove across the street to a gas station where he saw police cars. He told the officers, including Officer A, what happened. Officer A left the parking lot of the gas station and drove to the restaurant. He parked near the entrance of the restaurant and then walked to the corner of the building and looked into windows to assess the situation. West attempted to walk out of the restaurant twice. The first time, it appears as though he saw the police car and then turned to go back in after passing the first set of doors. Two customers and the manager of the restaurant saw West trying to conceal a gun in the waistband of his pants when he turned back around.  The second time, he exited the first set of doors and tried to walk past Officer A. The officer told West to either stop or go back into the restaurant. Witnesses say that West told the officer that the robber was still in the restaurant. Employees then told Officer A that West was the person who had just robbed the restaurant. Officer A told West to put his hands up. West started to raise his hands but then reached for the gun in his waistband. Officer A yelled at West, ǲdon’t do it, don’t do it.ǳ West pulled the gun out of his waistband and Officer A fired a shot. Officer A saw the gun was still pointed at him and fired another shot.
