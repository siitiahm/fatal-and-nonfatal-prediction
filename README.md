Describe your dataset: Our data set is one that contains information about 4400 fatal and nonfatal police shootings and contains incidents around the 2010s of the encounters.It contains things like the date, and factors of the subjects apperance that can strike implicit bias and racism commonly noticed in police encounters such as race and gender on whether or not it ended in a fatal vs. non fatal shooting.
What is the input?: Our inputs are the Date of the incident, NumberOfSubjects,Fatal (Or Non Fatal),SubjectArmed, SubjectRace, SubjectGender, SubjectAge, NatureOfStop, NumberOfShots, NumberOfOfficers,OfficerRace, OfficerGender, Department, FullNarrative, City, Notes
Did you have a meaning for the input feature?: Our input features gather all this information to see if our code/the machine can predict if a police encounter would be fatal or nonfatal based on things like race, age, gender and our other inputs
what is the output? how do you find this dataset?: We found this dataset on Kaggle.com, which includes data on whether a victim of fatal police shooting was tased before being lethally shot. https://www.kaggle.com/kwullum/fatal-police-shootings-in-the-us?select=PoliceKillingsUS.csv How to run your code? etc: Our output is the information of the Police shooting incidents with all the information we entered in and they are stored in the "test-data.txt" and the "training-data.txt". We used the ratio .7 for random splitting and normal splitting for our 2 txt files
