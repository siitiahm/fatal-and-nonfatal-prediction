Dataset:  
We are using a combination of several datasets from Kaggle.com Vice news, and from replication materials needed for a 
study published in PLoS One.
The [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/kwullum/fatal-police-shootings-in-the-us?select=PoliceKillingsUS.csv)
dataset contains 2,535 entries and was originally collected by the Washington Post. The 
[VICE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CaOQ7FUYsGFCHEqGzA2hlfj69sx3GE9GoJ40OcqI9KY/edit#gid=1271324584)
dataset contains 4,400 entries, but many entries had significant missing entries and were
excluded from our work. The [PLoS](https://github.com/jnixy/replication-materials/tree/master/nix_shjarback_PONE_2021/data) 
data contains several police shooting datasets collected from California, Colorado, Florida, and Texas.

Description:  
Our initial curiosities included questions such as: can AI recognize or highlight bias and discrimination? Can machine learning predict the likelihood of being fatally shot by police?
Can a machine learn to predict where shooting may occur? How can technology improve or exasperate fatal police encounters? 
What are the biggest factors, i.e. race, age, poverty status, hometown, socioeconomic status, considered before a fatal 
shooting occurs? This research will primarily investigate the following questions using several machine learning techniques:
1. Can Machine Learning  correctly predict who will be fatally shot by police?
2. What are the strongest predictors for who will be shot by police?  
As this research was conducted, several other curiosities arose about what ML algorithms are more suitable for predicting 
fatal police shootings, and how data collected from different institutions compare in terms of both data points and results 
predicted by our tool. Additionally, we will discuss the implications of our findings and whether or not the use of machine 
learning within this issue does more harm than good.
